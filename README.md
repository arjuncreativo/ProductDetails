# MyRetail Products

## Overview
The goal for this Project is to create an end-to-end Proof-of-Concept for a products API, which will aggregate product data from multiple sources and return it as JSON to the 
caller.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Exceptions
As ap part of POC this project uses python LRU caching to cache the Results of API. This can be replaced with in memmory caching tools like Redis or Memcached

As LRU cache does is just python memmory caching, it does not proved the support to clear an item by a id or pointer. So on price update the entire cache will be cleared. This can be fixed in production using memory object caching



## Usage

### Curl Request to Update the price

curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8090/v2/products/13860428' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "value": 21,
  "currency_code": "USD"
}'

### Curl Request to get the price 


curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8090/v2/products/13860428'




## Running with Docker
